## 1. Project Overview

**Context:** 
This project was developed as part of a hands-on end-to-end Excel dashboard project focused on analyzing furniture sales data across multiple regions in the United States.

**Problem Statement:** 
Businesses often struggle to quickly identify sales trends, profitable regions, top-performing categories, and shipping performance from large sales datasets.

**Approach:**  
Using Microsoft Excel, Power Query, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and slicers, raw sales data was cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and visualized into an interactive dashboard.

**Outcome:**
The final result is a dynamic sales performance dashboard that provides insights into revenue, profit, shipping methods, customer segments, and regional sales performance.

## 7. Analysis & Metrics

### Analytical Approach

This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Excel to examine furniture sales performance across regions, customer segments, product categories, and shipping methods. The goal is to identify trends, performance drivers, and business opportunities from transactional sales data.

The analysis was carried out using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Excel formulas to summarize and visualize key business metrics.


## Key Metrics Defined

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Total Sales | Total revenue generated from all furniture transactions | Measures overall business sales performance |
| Total Profit | Total profit earned after discounts and sales | Measures profitability performance |
| Total Quantity | Total number of products sold | Measures sales volume and customer demand |
| YoY Growth | Percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous year | Tracks yearly business performance changes |
| Shipping Duration | Number of days between order date and ship date | Evaluates delivery performance and shipping efficiency |

---
## Methods Used

- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
- KPI calculations for Sales, Profit, and Quantity
- Pivot Tables for summarization and aggregation
- Pivot Charts for monthly sales trend analysis
- Geographic sales analysis using Excel Map visuals
- Shipping mode and shipping duration analysis

## 10. Assumptions & Limitations

### Assumptions

- All transaction records in the dataset were assumed to be complete and accurate.
- Sales, profit, and discount values were assumed to be correctly recorded.
- Shipping duration values were assumed to reflect actual delivery timelines.
- Customer and regional information were assumed to be consistent across all records.

---

### Limitations

- The dataset is a sample/tutorial dataset and may not fully represent real-world business operations.
- The analysis focuses only on historical sales data and does not include predictive forecasting.
- Customer demographic and behavioral data were not included in the dataset.
- External business factors such as marketing spend, economic conditions, and competitor activity were not considered.
- The project was developed entirely in Excel without advanced statistical or machine learning analysis.

## 11. Future Enhancements

- [ ] Build a Power BI version of the dashboard for enhanced interactivity
- [ ] Add automated dashboard refresh using Power Query connections
- [ ] Include predictive sales forecasting analysis
- [ ] Expand the dashboard with additional KPIs and customer behavior analysis
